1272-128104-0000 MISTER COLTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL 
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER COULTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER 
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS OR ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OR OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND 
1272-128104-0003 HE IS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LEIGHTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OVER ROCKY ITHACA 
1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND ADAM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IT'LL SQUARE AS NATIONAL AS THE JINGO POEM AH MISTER BIRKET FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAIS LETTERS SHAMPOO RUMOURED TURKISH BATH NEXT MANUVRES 
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HALLOWED DELICATE IN EXPRESSION 
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER CROKER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY 
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE EFFECT 
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN 
1272-128104-0009 HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHELANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER 
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MANTEL BOARD 
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FULLEST OF THIS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING 
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD 
1272-128104-0013 MISTER CROKER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE POPPER OF PAINTING
