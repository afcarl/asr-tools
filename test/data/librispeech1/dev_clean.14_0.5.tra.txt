1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE 
1988-147956-0019 WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US 
1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRL'S SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM

1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE 
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES 
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN OLD CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIES AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE 
1988-148538-0005 I DON'T BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OFFER REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES ARE COMPOSED OF A VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH LANCES EXCEPT IN NAME 
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACED SEVERAL OPTICS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH

1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF FLAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES THAT NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION 
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEIR SCENE OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION

1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH 
1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS 
1993-147149-0002 THE GOAL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BALKED OF ITS PREY 
1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOW CRIPPLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PERISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT 
1993-147149-0004 MARGARET MET JIM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHER'S WAS SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME 
1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH TO WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN 
1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATHLIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN BUT SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM 
1993-147149-0007 OVER THE CHILD WHICH IT BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE 
1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU 
1993-147149-0009 BUT ERNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRING GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM 
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY 
1993-147149-0011 THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT 
1993-147149-0012 HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS 
1993-147149-0013 MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME 
1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING 
1993-147149-0015 BEFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD NOW HE AND HEARD HOW I HAVE WISHED AT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME 
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY 
1993-147149-0017 OH JIM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU 
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HANDS TOUCHED THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR 
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JAM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF 
1993-147149-0020 MARY I ALMOST LOATHED MYSELF WHEN I FEEL IT WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLEST 
1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UPSTAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME TO THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TRYING GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR 
1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO CHIN AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN 
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY 
1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WINNIE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM 
1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR EITHER CHECKED MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND INTENDED BY HALF 
1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE THINK BEFORE IT 
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SYMONS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES 
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE 
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER 
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON 
1993-147964-0000 THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLEADING WHIP LASHES 
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN 
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YOU OPEN ANTONIA EVEN YOU'LL GO WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW 
1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK 
1993-147964-0004 ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY 
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GIVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME 
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE 
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM 
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE 
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE 
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURLED SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MOUSTACHE 
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT 
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL 
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN I WAS HERE WITH US 
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE 
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM 
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMMERED A WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE ADMITTED 
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND IMPASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS 
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN 
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK 
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN THE THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER 
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISS ASSHER MURDER HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE

1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBROSE SCHMEIE MAMMA COME HERE 
1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN THEM

1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AN NO MISTAKE 
2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER 
2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER 
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE CHIMERAS I FOUND AND NEA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AND BROCHE NEEDED 
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HETTY IS LYING 
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE 
2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN 
2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I'M JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED 
2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY 
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD 
2035-147960-0009 LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID 
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO AUNT MIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LUFFTON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES 
2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED AND NEA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK 
2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH A SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE

2035-147960-0014 YOU COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DO HE FIGHT HARD 
2035-147960-0015 HO WINKED AT ME 
2035-147960-0016 THE SNAKE OF ITS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN A BOY HE COULD HANDLE 
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SCH AMERICA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW 
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER 
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US 
2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK 
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WITH SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW 
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMY IS RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON 
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED 
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM 
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DAS ISLE 
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST 
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WOULD ROUND HIM 
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT 
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP 
2035-147961-0013 AND SEE US FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY 
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS 
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US 
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN 
2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHERMAN A WENT WITH HIM 
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENTWOOD DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE 
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HULLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS 
2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY 
2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HIND MOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT UP IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVER TURNED 
2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER 
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOMS THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND 
2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED 
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES PALL THE LAST TOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US 
2035-147961-0026 THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW 
2035-147961-0027 YES HOW MANY 
2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH 
2035-147961-0029 NOW AS NO HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRIED BY THE OTHER TWO 
2035-147961-0030 PABLO KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM 
2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEATS ON NOTHING 
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAN AIR LOUDER THAN THEY IF I HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS 
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE 
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM 
2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FOR WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE 
2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES 
2035-147961-0037 EVERYONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COWL BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER 
2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SCH AMERICA 
2035-147961-0039 WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING 
2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE 
2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES 
2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGO SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LOW CENSURES BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION 
2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLANE OF MOIRA 
2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY 
2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE 
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BELLE MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND HE OVERTHREW ALL OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLANE OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE 
2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN 
2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH EARN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF COMBLES ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINN KNOCKED UP 
2035-152373-0008 AS LEADING TO THE MANSION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER 
2035-152373-0009 THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNIZES THEIR APOSTLE SAINT EATIN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA 
2035-152373-0010 THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER 
2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH THE MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS 
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY IT WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL 
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED AND THE WRATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE 
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT AS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE CONVERTED PEOPLE 
2035-152373-0015 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST 
2035-152373-0016 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY 
2035-152373-0017 SAINT MALO SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SEEDED DOWN MAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS 
2035-152373-0018 NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD 
2078-142845-0000 KIRKLEATHAM YEAST 
2078-142845-0001 SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN 
2078-142845-0002 TO MAKE GOOD HOME MADE BREAD 
2078-142845-0003 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN 
2078-142845-0004 VOGT PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON THE HOLLOW OUT THE MEDAL BUT DO NOT CLEARED ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR ELEVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO 
2078-142845-0005 NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BRUGES EAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN EAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MAKES IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTER PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD 
2078-142845-0006 LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST IS RISEN AND BROKEN THROUGH THE FLOWER SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH 
2078-142845-0007 THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A STRONG CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR IN TO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOWERS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT PLAIN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE 
2078-142845-0008 TURN IT THEN ON TO A PASTEBOARD OR VERY CLEAN DRESSER AND WITH A LARGE SHARP KNIFE DIVIDED IN TO MAKE IT UP QUICKLY AND THE LOAVES AND DESPATCH IT TO THE OVEN MAKE ONE OR TWO INCISIONS ACROSS THE TOP OF BLOWS AS THEY WILL RISE MORE EASILY IF THIS BE DONE 
2078-142845-0009 ILLUSTRATION ITALIAN MILLET 
2078-142845-0010 ITALIAN MELLOT OR GREAT INDIAN MILLET IS CULTIVATED IN EGYPT AND NEW BIA WHERE IT IS CALLED IT TO DORA AND IS USED AS HUMAN FOOD AS WELL AS FOR THE FERMENTATION OF BEER 
2078-142845-0011 IT WILL GROW ON POOR SOILS AND IS EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE 
2078-142845-0012 IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BRED FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTIC FOWLS 
2078-142845-0013 THE YELLOW VARIETY CALLED GOLDEN MILLET IS SOLD AND THE GROCERS SHOPS FOR MAKING PUDDINGS AND IS VERY DELICATE AND WHOLESOME 
2078-142845-0014 ANOTHER ADVANTAGE THE RED WEEDS POSSESS AS THEIR COMPARATIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE ATTACKS OF MILDEW AND FLY 
2078-142845-0015 MOTE BOIL THE RICE IN WATER AND TILL IT IS QUITE TENDER POUR OFF THE WATER AND PUT THE RICE BEFORE IT IS COLD TO THE FLOWER 
2078-142845-0016 ILLUSTRATION MAIZE PLANT 
2078-142845-0017 MAY'S NEXT TO WEED IN RICE MAIZE IS THE GRAIN MOST USED IN THE NOURISHMENT OF MAN 
2078-142845-0018 IF CARRIED ANY DISTANCE IT SHOULD BE STORED AWAY IN AIR TIGHT VESSELS 
2078-142845-0019 SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS OF MAIZE FLOUR ARE VERY GOOD AND WHEN PARTAKEN IN MODERATION SUITABLE FOOD FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY 
2078-142845-0020 MODE LET THE CHAIR TARIK ACID AND SALT BE REDUCED TO THE FINEST POSSIBLE POWER THEN MIX THEM WELL WITH THE FLOUR 
2078-142845-0021 SOUR MILK OR BUTTERMILK MAY BE USED BUT THEN A LITTLE LESS ACID WILL BE NEEDED 
2078-142845-0022 EXCELLENT ROLLS 
2078-142845-0023 HOT ROLLS 
2078-142845-0024 SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR 
2078-142845-0025 WHEN THEY ARE QUITE HOT DIVIDE THEM LENGTHWISE INTO THREE PUT SOME THIN FLAKES OF GOOD BUTTER BETWEEN THE SLICES PRESSED THE ROLLS TOGETHER AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT NOT LONGER OR THE BUTTER WOULD OIL TAKEN OUT OF THE OVEN SPREAD THE BUTTER EQUALLY OVER DIVIDE THE ROLLS IN HALF AND PUT THEM ON TO A VERY HOT CLEAN DISH AND SEND THEM INSTANTLY TO TABLE 
2078-142845-0026 TO MAKE IT DRY TOAST 
2078-142845-0027 NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT 
2078-142845-0028 MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRE THAT IT BLACKENS 
2078-142845-0029 TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX 
2078-142845-0030 A LOAF OF HOUSEHOLD BREAD ABOUT TWO DAYS OLD ANSWERS FOR MAKING TOAST BETTER THAN COTTAGE BREAD THE LATTER NOT BEING A GOOD SHAPE AND TO CHRISTIE FOR THE PURPOSE 
2078-142845-0031 CUT AS MANY NICE EVEN SLICES AS MAY BE REQUIRED RATHER MORE THAN ONE QUARTER INCH IN THICKNESS AND TOAST THEM BEFORE A VERY BRIGHT FIRE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE BREAD TO BLACKEN WHICH SPOILS THE APPEARANCE AND FLAVOUR OF ALL TOAST

1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST 
1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRIANS BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTHS OF ASIE HOLY GARMENT HE WORE 
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVER STRAINED EYES EVEN TO SOARING TO REUNITE AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT 
1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST 
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZZER SOUNDED 
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT 
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZARDS WERE TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES AND COMPLETE RELAXATION 
1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON OTHER STRONG MEASURED RATE 
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THERE FOUR NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH 
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS 
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND 
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAND IS THE ONE I MUST SEE THAT STAND ASIDE 
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTIES 
1272-141231-0014 HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE HE INTRUDERS HAD QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY FOR BEING A FOOL OUT 
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRIENNE WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP 
1272-141231-0016 TEN SECONDS 
1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED AND CLARKE WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES 
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY 
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE PART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING 
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER 
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS 
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WAS THE DEFT ROMOLA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE 
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOME ONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS 
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS 
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING AND TWENTIES AND GUEST DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT 
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRIANS SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED CROESUS 
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM A SECOND STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD 
1272-141231-0028 HER OLD CLOCK AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK AND SMILED 
1272-141231-0029 HE SAID IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE TO BOTH WORKED TO EXHAUSTION 
1272-141231-0030 BRIENNE SO SOMETHING CLOSED PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR 
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM OUR OLD BRIN SENSED IT AND KNEW THAT THIS POINT WAS HIS 
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE PURFLED TWISTS A THRUST TO THE SIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD 
2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT 
2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND 
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY IN A NATURAL ATTITUDE 
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANY THING OF THIS NATURE 
2086-149214-0004 WE TRUST NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFEND BY LAYING OUT A STREET IT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIOR RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS ALL MENUS FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR 
2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET 
2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSE BUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND THE PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRENT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS 
2086-149220-0002 THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS OF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING 
2086-149220-0003 SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THE GOLDEN BLOSSOM QUE CUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AN ABUNDANT HARVEST 
2086-149220-0004 PHOEBE WANDERED HIS CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY 
2086-149220-0005 THESE TWO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDES SOME FARMHOUSE MILES AWAY 
2086-149220-0006 THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH THE RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES 
2086-149220-0007 IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY SHALL DECLARE HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN 
2086-149220-0008 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE 
2086-149220-0009 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN A DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THE DUKE WHO BREWS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE 
2086-149220-0010 THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS 
2086-149220-0011 THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HANDS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPSA DISTURBANCE THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BUT TRICKS THESE FOREIGN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE 
2086-149220-0012 THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COUPE AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE SHOT DECLARING THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDE LONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THIS SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER 
2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOUR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY 
2086-149220-0014 HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES 
2086-149220-0015 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD 
2086-149220-0016 MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILLIN TO WEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PENSION 
2086-149220-0017 AH BUT THESE HANDS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN BEAST AND THE HEIRESS TO CREDIT LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARNYARD FOWL 
2086-149220-0018 I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PENSION 
2086-149220-0019 MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH THE MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THAT THE GUERO TIGHTNESS OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA 
2086-149220-0020 I TURNED UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME 
2086-149220-0021 IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT 
2086-149220-0022 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE THE GUERO TYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE 
2086-149220-0023 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ASSO 
2086-149220-0024 THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE 
2086-149220-0025 WELL WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE NEAREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH THE TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT 
2086-149220-0026 YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION 
2086-149220-0027 HE EXHIBITED AT THE GUERO TIGHT MINIATURES AND A MOROCCO CASE 
2086-149220-0028 HE BE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK 
2086-149220-0029 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS THE MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET 
2086-149220-0030 THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART 
2086-149220-0031 HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITH ALL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE 
2086-149220-0032 AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL 
2086-149220-0033 WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT 
2086-149220-0034 IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SON TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD 
2086-149220-0035 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE 
2086-149220-0036 IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN 
2086-149220-0037 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HATH SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE 
2086-149220-0038 SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABOURERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM 
2086-149220-0039 SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE IT 
2086-149220-0040 OH REJOINED THE GARROTE TYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED 
2086-149220-0041 SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS THE CORNER 
2086-149220-0042 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE 
2086-149220-0043 WHAT AN INSTRUMENT AS THE HUMAN VOICE 
2086-149220-0044 HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL 
2086-149220-0045 FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM 
2086-149220-0046 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST 
2086-149220-0047 I WILL SIT IN THE PARLOR AWHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS 
2086-149220-0048 WHILE THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPPED FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND SMALL SHE WAS SWELL 
2086-149220-0049 I'VE SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF THE DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION 
2277-149874-0000 MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLAW RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABORERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR 
2277-149874-0001 TO CARRY THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINGLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL 
2277-149874-0002 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE 
2277-149874-0003 HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE 
2277-149874-0004 HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM 
2277-149874-0005 SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION IN THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION 
2277-149874-0006 THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED 
2277-149874-0007 THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH THE THIN RAG CARPET 
2277-149874-0008 THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT 
2277-149874-0009 ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING 
2277-149874-0010 NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE 
2277-149874-0011 HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE 
2277-149874-0012 MANY BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF 
2277-149874-0013 YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR 
2277-149874-0014 SHE ASKED MANY FOR EATIN PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN CUT OUT YOUR WAS SCARRED AND RENT HIM 
2277-149874-0015 SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID 
2277-149874-0016 ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH 
2277-149874-0017 A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEWCOMER 
2277-149874-0018 IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK 
2277-149874-0019 NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE 
2277-149874-0020 IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET 
2277-149874-0021 THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY 
2277-149896-0000 HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE 
2277-149896-0001 HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID 
2277-149896-0002 HIRST WOULD WALK THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION 
2277-149896-0003 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION 
2277-149896-0004 HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT 
2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOIST HAND 
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THUS SATISFACTORILY FOR CAREY WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY 
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL 
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALDAMA LIVES HAD BEEN SKINNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED 
2277-149896-0009 WELL THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS 
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DREAD THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT 
2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING 
2277-149896-0012 SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING 
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE 
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON TIRE 
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE 
2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIS WIFE EITHER 
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM 
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO READ THE FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL 
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY 
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK 
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CON FOUNDED WRETCH 
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF 
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE 
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP 
2277-149896-0025 HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET 
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM 
2277-149896-0027 HIRST WOULD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING 
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA 
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING 
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE CAN DO IT UP HERE 
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROM 
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT 
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER 
2277-149896-0034 HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER 
2277-149897-0000 WHEN HARRIS WOULD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER 
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALIZE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT 
2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING 
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE 
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NOT THE NATION FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM 
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT IN ON THE LIP PLACED IN IT BE REQUESTED TO MOUNT AND SLOWLY FILLED IT UP 
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE 
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE OMELET AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURST WOULD YES SIR SAID THE BOY 
2277-149897-0008 AND HE ANSWERED I GUESS NOT 
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELT IN HIS MUSINGS 
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT 
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE OMELET AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED 
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT 
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE ROSE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING 
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED 
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED 
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK 
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET A RIGHT HAND RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUBJECT 
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM 
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER 
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLINT OF DEFEAT 
2277-149897-0021 HE THOUGHT A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE 
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CAREY AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA 
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE 
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING 
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY 
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE 
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS 
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE'S DEAD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER 
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MAID TO GO OUT TO CARRY BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY 
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE 
2277-149897-0031 HE TRAVELLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY 
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED 
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMESON HAY IT READ 
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURST WOULD FORT DIVORCE AND ALIMONY 
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE 
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT 
2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUIT HIM PROMPTLY 
2412-153947-0000 PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 
2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE 
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER 
2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER 
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THE REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES THEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY 
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF A BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE 
2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER 
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAD TREATED MY ADVENTURES 
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RAGGED TATTERED DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRIST CHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE 
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION 
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MISS SEARS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUEBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO 
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVORABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH 
2412-153947-0012 THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE 
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MALTS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY 
2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW ADDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THAT MAID 
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF YOUR WINE THAT WERE REPEATEDLY RE WRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD 
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPY RIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS 
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF 
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REACH ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE 
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO 
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THIS SEASON LEST THE READER SHE GATHERED WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS 
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BREAD WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE 
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND OR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET 
2412-153948-0007 THEY WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEEL AS TWO OR THREE BLACK YEWS AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM 
2412-153948-0008 IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED 
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL 
2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED 
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GRAY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SABLE LOST LAMB BLEEDING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THERE WAS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING 
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL 
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOP IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN 
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT 
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY A NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO 
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE 
2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDE HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM 
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND PAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN 
2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME 
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF CHOCOLATES WHICH HAD TAKEN RODIN VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST 
2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT 
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY 
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL CALMLY AND THE OLD GRAYBEARD WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN 
2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL 
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN 
2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN ARE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY 
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED 
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING 
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AN ENORMOUS TAILS 
2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER 
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKE HIM BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WAN HANDSOME 
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT 
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL THAT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM 
2412-153954-0018 IF THOU MY PULSE THEY LOOK TO MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELL ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOK TO THE CHEAP AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT 
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY MY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH 
2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THERE WAS A VEILED CARRIAGES WHEELS IN SPITE OF REST IN DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR WERE IRON RAILS 
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME NO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES 
2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME 
2412-153954-0023 THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM 
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER 
2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP AT MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON 
2428-83699-0001 FESTIVE YES 
2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE 
2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER 
2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD 
2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING BUT A KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT 
2428-83699-0006 NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MARRIAGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY 
2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE 
2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO 
2428-83699-0009 I HAD NO ILLUSIONS 
2428-83699-0010 I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT 
2428-83699-0011 ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING 
2428-83699-0012 I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS 
2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON 
2428-83699-0014 IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY 
2428-83699-0015 HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON 
2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF 
2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WAS STATION MASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO 
2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGER DEAN THAT THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION 
2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY IN BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING 
2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART 
2428-83699-0021 IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE 
2428-83699-0022 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT 
2428-83699-0023 I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT 
2428-83699-0024 I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY 
2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE 
2428-83699-0026 HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE STILL 
2428-83699-0027 THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND THEM 
2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF THEM HAVE AND TWISTED IT OFF 
2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY 
2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL 
2428-83699-0031 BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD 
2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING 
2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEM LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE 
2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR 
2428-83699-0035 A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE 
2428-83699-0036 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER 
2428-83699-0037 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AND EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE 
2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVES HERE AND THE PEOPLE MAD 
2428-83699-0039 I TOLD THE BELL AGAIN 
2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF ON FASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND 
2428-83699-0041 I AM MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON 
2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT 
2428-83705-0000 HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST 
2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS 
2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARIANNE'S THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE MARKED 
2428-83705-0003 IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL 
2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOMEONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO ON IMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT 
2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING 
2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING 
2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL WAS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT 
2428-83705-0008 I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED 
2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT 
2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE 
2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES 
2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARIAN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT 
2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS 
2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTY FOR ALL I KNOW 
2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIG STY AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT 
2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE 
2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS 
2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR 
2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS 
2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT 
2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST 
2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BIAS 
2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GETS IT 
2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER 
2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE AS A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT 
2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY IN A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING 
2428-83705-0027 HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS 
2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS 
2428-83705-0029 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS 
2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARIANA WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOURS ASSIDUITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE 
2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE 
2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND 
2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARIANNE PRESENCE AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAD BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO 
2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY 
2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARIANNE GIVEN YOU HER LOVE 
2428-83705-0036 SOME ONE SNIGGERED 
2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE 
2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT 
2428-83705-0039 P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING 
2428-83705-0040 WE ARE GOING FOR A HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE 
2428-83705-0041 A SECOND COUSIN OF MARIANNE'S ISN'T THE COOK'S TOURS LINE 
2428-83705-0042 HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COOL PONDS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT 
2428-83705-0043 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COOL PUNS IN RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE 
251-118436-0000 HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE 
251-118436-0001 I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED 
251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM 
251-118436-0003 AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARDED NOW 
251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WEANED FROM HIS MOUTH 
251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER 
251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD 
251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY 
251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGER NAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR 
251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF INDIA THE STARS ARE AND TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT 
251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER 
251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS 
251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCES OF COURSE ALLAH WHO LOVED BELINDA CHIMED VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE 
251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT 
251-118436-0014 WHEN THE DEUS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY ALL FULL PAROXYSMS 
251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY 
251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THE HANDS ARE TO HELL AND THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS 
251-118436-0017 THEIR FINGERS SERE ME LIKE FIRE 
251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE 
251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FALL NIGHT WEARIED OF THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH 
251-118436-0020 DON'T CRY AND A GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST 
251-118436-0021 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER 
251-118436-0022 YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND

251-136532-0000 THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN BILMA 
251-136532-0001 BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS 
251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTRE OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY 
251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND AT HOME MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE THAT SUPPORT IT 
251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRD LIKE CLAWS AND A HERBAL WAR ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIG LIKE THING IN THE BIG DARK HALL THE MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD 
251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWS CAST FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME 
251-136532-0006 TOADY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS 
251-136532-0007 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE 
251-136532-0008 GLORIOUS STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOESN'T HALF OF THEM 
251-136532-0009 WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION 
251-136532-0010 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT 
251-136532-0011 NOW WHAT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT 
251-136532-0012 A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACEFORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR 
251-136532-0013 MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOR HIS WOODS IN THE CORNERS 
251-136532-0014 YES CHARCOAL 
251-136532-0015 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LET THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP 
251-136532-0016 THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF ALIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING 
251-136532-0017 TONY LATIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AN IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET 
251-136532-0018 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY 
251-136532-0019 NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY 
251-136532-0020 BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATISE IT

1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN IN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE

1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST 
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH THE AMUSEMENT SIR HARRYS JUDICIAL FROWN 
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMS FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MEYNELL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT 
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA 
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SENSE 
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY IN PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY 
251-137823-0000 I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED 
251-137823-0001 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELLA ME DURING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND 
251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TESTING ROUTINE IS IT 
251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE 
251-137823-0004 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH 
251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PAINTING MARC FABER BENEATH IT 
251-137823-0006 BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE 
251-137823-0007 FOUR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE 
251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION 
251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST 
251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON HIS SUPPORTING TRESSES 
251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY 
251-137823-0012 HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED 
251-137823-0013 WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WILL GET AN AMBULANCE 
251-137823-0014 THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION 
251-137823-0015 LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER 
251-137823-0016 AND THE OLE TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY 
251-137823-0017 ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US 
251-137823-0018 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS 
251-137823-0019 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS 
251-137823-0020 THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED 
251-137823-0021 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN 
251-137823-0022 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF 
251-137823-0023 HE'S A GREAT SCIENTIST 
251-137823-0024 TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY 
251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL 
251-137823-0026 MISTER SWIFT'S EYES TWINKLED 
2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR IS MASS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN 
2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HOLE WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECT OF ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRAKE 
2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE HIM 
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED 
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE POMPOUS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES AND NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS 
2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON 
2803-154320-0006 WHAT THEN MY LORD 
2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN 
2803-154320-0008 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JUN 
2803-154320-0009 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN 
2803-154320-0010 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT 
2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLYNNE NARBONNE THINK OF MARY GRANT 
2803-154320-0012 WE'LL HALLE IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN 
2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE AND THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER 
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID 
2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAIKIKI RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY 
2803-154328-0001 THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH 
2803-154328-0002 THE MEAL ENDED 
2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN HER EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING 
2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE 
2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAVE A NOBLE END IN VIEW 
2803-154328-0006 GLYNN MARVIN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED 
2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN 
2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFIL THAT PROMISE 
2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HOWEVER AND MARY GRANT 
2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT 
2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER AND NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED 
2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE THE SCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK 
2803-154328-0013 YES SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP 
2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT 
2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND ALL THE NET JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS IN ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH HER NAILS WAL'R MORE READY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD FOR A CREVICE OF THE MATTING 
2803-154328-0016 WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT 
2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS THIS SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING 
2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED DOWN AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION 
2803-154328-0019 IF JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PIONEERED AVOIDED THAT KNIFE WHICH NOPPER TRUE DID ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT 
2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUND TO THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GO IN OUR ROOM AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES 
2803-154328-0021 WHAT'S THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT 
2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE 
2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU 
2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES 
2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS AND TO THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WHISPER SONGS 
2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHADE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING 
2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARNED AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE 
2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENED SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPED DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US 
2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF LITTLE CARDS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN OFF AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES 
2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE 
2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IF THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LIE IN A SLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED ON MONG THEM 
2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DEFINITE ROUNDED LIKE A NUTSHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS POWER 
2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES IN ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NO I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW COAL FIRE AND HOW AY IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES 
2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS THE WOOD BLAZE SEEN IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COLE WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL 
2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY 
2803-161169-0012 THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WIND NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS HIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE 
2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND 
2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAFF FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANYTHING FOR HARM ONLY 
2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT 
2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REEF USE COAL TAR 
2803-161169-0017 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERINE TO HEAL THEM 
2902-9006-0000 ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABORS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE 
2902-9006-0001 IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCHES CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN FACTS DESERVE 
2902-9006-0002 NOT TO BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF MORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES 
2902-9006-0003 THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS OF THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND ARE MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS 
2902-9006-0004 THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE 
2902-9006-0005 JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO EXCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS 
2902-9006-0006 BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT 
2902-9006-0007 IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL IN CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THE OSSA FEES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES 
2902-9006-0008 THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOREVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFY HER OF THE HUMAN SOUL 
2902-9006-0009 BUT THE HEALTH OF THE CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH HE PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS 
2902-9006-0010 THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT 
2902-9006-0011 AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE HERO OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND 
2902-9006-0012 TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE OX AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE 
2902-9006-0013 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND A ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASA SAVELLI WAS SOON FOUND 
2902-9006-0014 HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS AND REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DE LUGE BURST OF THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES 
2902-9006-0015 THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF WRAPPING HAD ACCUMULATED AROUND THE CAPITAL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSEHIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA 
2902-9006-0016 THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN THAN HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE 
2902-9006-0017 CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE IN THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND THE BOTCHED SLAVEHOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE OF THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE AN EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE 
2902-9006-0018 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSICS SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN ON MEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO SEERS AND HOMO I DOSIA'S MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET THE BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THEE FEET REMAINS OF THE VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE 
2902-9006-0019 TO SEND THESE USES MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY 
2902-9006-0020 I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS 
2902-9008-0000 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN TONY PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CAL MARCUS AND LYCOPHRON 
2902-9008-0001 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARMCHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE 
2902-9008-0002 BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE 
2902-9008-0003 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIGHT CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN 
2902-9008-0004 IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN ELECT 
2902-9008-0005 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE VULGAR HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF THAT PACKET 
2902-9008-0006 TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE 
2902-9008-0007 I TOO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORPHYRY HIMSELF TO EVIL LIES AND MAGIC 
2902-9008-0008 WHAT DO I CARE FOR FOOD 
2902-9008-0009 HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOUT THE STARS STILLED EVERY MOMENT TO WORTH 
2902-9008-0010 AY SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS 
2902-9008-0011 THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BRETT UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH 
2902-9008-0012 STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND TO BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS 
2902-9008-0013 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE'S THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUABILITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER 
2902-9008-0014 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIO WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MONDAIN HATRED 
2902-9008-0015 HIS EXCELLENCY THAT THE PREFECT 
2902-9008-0016 AND WHY SHOULD NOT DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER 
3000-15664-0000 SHASTA RAMBLES AND MORAG MEMORIES 
3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY IN DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS 
3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF 
3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU 
3000-15664-0004 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT 
3000-15664-0005 ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY IT OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE UNBURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT 
3000-15664-0006 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED 
3000-15664-0007 THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME 
3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HEARERS SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SCENES AND COMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME 
3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING IN BA'WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST 
3000-15664-0010 EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND THE CURRENTS OF SOUND AND THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE A STAR 
3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP AROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF 
3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND A BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL 
3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE IT DEEPER SILENCE 
3000-15664-0014 AND SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTH WESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE 
3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT IT SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY TO THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE 
3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGY AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ELDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING 
3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MOORINGS SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH 
3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GREY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEMED REMARKABLY SMOOTH AN ARM BROKEN 
3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO APPEARANCE SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT 
3000-15664-0020 TRACING HIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE COLLYER CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA HAS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY 
3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WAS CALLED THE CEDARS TISHY BROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS 
3000-15664-0022 HERE HE STRUCK THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN 
3000-15664-0023 NOT GRAMMAR IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION 
3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN A JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AND EVERY ALARM 
3000-15664-0025 WHILE TRAVELLING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK 
3000-15664-0026 THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY 
3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE 
3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE 
3000-15664-0029 THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS 
3000-15664-0030 THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH 
3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK 
3000-15664-0032 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE 
3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROUGHT RUGGED CURVE HONEST CLOUD LIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVER LIKE GOLD WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS TO THE FORESTS TO THE SEA 
3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING AND SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MACLEOD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRANG ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE 
3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEMED SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOUR BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FALL THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT 
3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS 
3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM 
3000-15664-0038 S PLENTY ON IT BELOW BE UM WHO'D SHERIF HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA 
3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS 
3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGES FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES 
3000-15664-0041 TRACING THE MACLEOD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES IT NO HARDSHIP 
3000-15664-0042 THE SCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING 
3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES 
3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDER OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TATO 
3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY WAS HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED 
3000-15664-0046 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED 
3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE 
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS 
3081-166546-0002 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE 
3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT TO THEIR AUNT 
3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONGING TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A WIDOWER 
3081-166546-0005 GEORGE NODDED 
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT 
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME 
3081-166546-0008 GEORGE 
3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS SULLA SIGH 
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT TO THE ALTERNATIVE IT IS SO IMPROBABLE 
3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LIVE WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT 
3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING 
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER 
3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY 
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOK WHAT HIM NELL 
3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH 
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S WORK COURIER ALL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS 
3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT 
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE 
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME 
3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY 
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS A DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE 
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS HAD TO LEARN IT FOR HIM 
3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN 
3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON 
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS 
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER OF A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT 
3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE 
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT 
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED 
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVES BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM 
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST IN EXPLICABLE THEY AIR 
3081-166546-0033 BUT CLUES THERE ABSOLUTELY NONE 
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN 
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE 
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND CRIES 
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR 
3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER 
3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL 
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN 
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT OR ICE 
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL 
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD 
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE 
3081-166546-0045 THIS THE SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS POWDER JAYS AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVORITE 
3081-166546-0046 BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY 
3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER IN ME 
3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS 
3081-166546-0049 BUT I AM IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES 
3081-166546-0050 OLD DAYS DON'T RETURNED FOR THE ASKING 
3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW 
3081-166546-0052 WHAT ARE TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL 
3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST 
3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND PILES HENNER BIRD 
3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS 
3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY 
3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN 
3081-166546-0058 YES MISS CLARK THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARISHES 
3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY 
3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON 
3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DARK DREW WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING 
3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED 
3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT 
3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT 
3081-166546-0065 BUT NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME 
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR 
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE 
3081-166546-0068 BUT BELL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU 
3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL 
3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND DRAMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS 
3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE 
3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBT HE HAD BEEN IN THIS INSTANCE 
3081-166546-0073 YES 
3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY 
3081-166546-0075 YES MANY TIMES 
3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE 
3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY THE TI HI SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY 
3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE AND SHOULD SAY 
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYES SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION 
3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW 
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO POIGNARD IN THE WOUND 
3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND INTO THAT ONE MISS CLARK WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER 
3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER 
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELPED ME OUT OF THIS 
3081-166546-0085 BUT THE VICAR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARK AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR 
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS 
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDE FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS 
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER 
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN INVOLVED 
3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONORABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT AS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED 
3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE OF IT THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY 
3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH A VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE 
3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE WELL TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER ONES THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL 
3170-137482-0004 A SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER 
3170-137482-0005 YOU WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES 
3170-137482-0006 WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SAT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH 
3170-137482-0007 WHATEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS OF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS 
3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS 
3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZINE NO 
3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAINED A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY 
3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZINE O CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH 
3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK ALL THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT 
3170-137482-0013 WHERE IS MY HUSBAND 
3170-137482-0014 NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW 
3170-137482-0015 MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THINKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH 
3170-137482-0016 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NATURAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF 
3170-137482-0017 I WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER THEY MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING 
3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NATURAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED 
3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM 
3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE 
3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING 
3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND THOUGHT MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT ROSETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON OF THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME 
3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST LEADING PRESCRIBED BY ME 
3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED 
3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE 
3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM 
3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TARO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING IN THE CURIO OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION 
3170-137482-0028 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WOULD LAY DOWN AGAIN 
3170-137482-0029 HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH 
3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKE TO PUTT 
3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY 
3170-137482-0033 THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED 
3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE 
3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THE QUESTION HE GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER 
3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I CANNOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER 
3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS 
3170-137482-0038 NOT FOR LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION 
3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE 
3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DOUBLE AND SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT 
3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL JE VEUX TEAS AND FULL OF SCRUPLES 
3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT AS THE WOODS 
3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORELLI I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM 
3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND A VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THAN MATE WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND 
3170-137482-0045 WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE 
3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA LECTURE ORDERS MY OWN TABLE IN TEN SEQUINS A MONTH 
3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOU ARE ADVISER AND EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND 
3170-137482-0048 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER 
3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION 
3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS 
3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WE INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE 
3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOR OF HER RETURN 
3536-23268-0004 I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASSED THIS EVENING AT HOME 
3536-23268-0005 I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT SHE WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME 
3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT 
3536-23268-0007 MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED 
3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABORS TAKEN THE LEASE FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE 
3536-23268-0009 MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR 
3536-23268-0010 AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR 
3536-23268-0011 HER HANDS FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING 
3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HERS 
3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL 
3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW 
3536-23268-0015 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE ROOM THIS EVENING 
3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED 
3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HANDS 
3536-23268-0018 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE JINGLE OF A TEASPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET 
3536-23268-0019 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE 
3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENTS COULD NOT INCREASE THEM 
3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOUR TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES RED AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL THAT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER 
3536-23268-0022 DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED 
3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA 
3536-23268-0024 DORRIFORTH THEN LAY THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN 
3536-23268-0025 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES ON MANNERLY 
3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM 
3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPRESSED 
3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED 
3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY 
3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH 
3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY NO BROWN SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES 
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BASEL THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE 
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOR 
3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL 
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOSWELL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM AT MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER 
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS 
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND 
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BASILE 
3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INVENTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOSTIL'S LAW 
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE UNCANNY 
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TWO OR IT MAY PROVE BEGAN AND THAT HE DO THEM THAT HER LETTER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN 
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BUSTLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BASEL TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD 
3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY ONCE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS 
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES THEM THAT WON'T SAY WHAT 
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD BE 
3536-8226-0015 TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED 
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BASILE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN 
3536-8226-0017 THEN BASEL CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE 
3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS 
3536-8226-0019 BASILE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES 
3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BASILE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME 
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN 
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BASILE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT 
3536-8226-0023 BASILE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY 
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN 
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKIP SIR SUGGESTED BASEL 
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED 
3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM 
3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES 
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED THE SHARP IS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR 
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'D BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE 
3536-8226-0031 AND BASEL AS HE SAID THIS IS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD 
3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BASEL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK 
3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SOME CHOW WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIME MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASSED THE GATES OF SLEEP 
3576-138058-0001 THE DONKEY O'TEI WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES 
3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SALT DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASKED AGAIN AT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA 
3576-138058-0003 ALWAYS TOUCHING ME AND I AM TRUSTING ME 
3576-138058-0004 TILSA NEHA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING HENRICO HEARTLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE ON TRUST MYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT DID GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES 
3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS CENTRAL GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVED NOR BREATHED 
3576-138058-0006 HOW NOW OLD TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON'T YO DA 
3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THAT HE MASTERED AND NATURAL LORD

3576-138058-0009 DON'T HE LOOK HE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO EQUIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED 
3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM 
3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM 
3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF 
3576-138058-0013 SUMTER REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS 
3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE AND BRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOWED HIS HEAD IN RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVORABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY 
3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PATTERN ELSE IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST 
3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO THESEUS AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED

3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH THESE 
3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNISING CLAUDIA SAID PACEY CLARITY FEAR HAD MISTAKENLY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN HERE A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARD THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO HER NOR COULD I HAVE WRONGED THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED

1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE 
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS 
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED 
1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE 
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT THE CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT 
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY IN JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER 
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY 
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD

1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO PARLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY 
1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP THE WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY 
1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GOING ABOUT HER EYES 
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT

1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER 
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING 
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOUR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH 
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER 
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED 
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE 
1462-170142-0023 I THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT 
1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE VERY FIRST 
1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN

1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TWO

1462-170142-0029 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY 
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG 
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR 
1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED 
1462-170142-0033 BARNEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH

3752-4944-0052 NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE INSULT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP 
3752-4944-0053 SHOW MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROPE OCCUR PLAN IS TO HAVE A HUNDRED LASHES TO MORROW 
3752-4944-0054 I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S MASTER HERE MY GOOD SIR

3752-4944-0058 I'LL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT

3752-4944-0060 O GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH AID ME HELP ME 
3752-4944-0061 O LORD LOOK DOWN UPON ME 
3752-4944-0062 HE MIXED A TEASPOON OF THIS IN A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT 
3752-4944-0063 IT RELIEVED HIM FOR AWHILE 
3752-4944-0064 IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF THE DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE 
3752-4944-0065 I MUST HAVE A TEASPOONFUL HE SAID TO ALLAY THE CRAVING 
3752-4944-0066 TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL 
3752-4944-0067 HE SMELT THE NUTTY AROMA OF THE SPIRIT 
3752-4944-0068 THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME YOU WAS INFAMOUS THAT ADVICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN 
3752-4944-0069 IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE 
3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND TO LOVE IN THE OTHER 
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID 
3853-163249-0002 SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROSTHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST 
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANYTHING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKER ISH LOVE FOR DANCING A JIG 
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY 
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT 
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE 
3853-163249-0007 I GOT TO LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE 
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTIE AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD 
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTY BUT HOW WILL THAT SUIT 
3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE IF YOUR SWORD IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND TO BE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL 
3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW 
3853-163249-0012 THEN HE WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES ENTWINED SIMILE LACKS REEVES HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND TO DEATH 
3853-163249-0013 JUNO HOME IN THE LAND STOOD THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE 
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION 
3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS 
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SANE GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR 
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NO BULLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOOSEN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRIED TO DO AS WELL 
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT PETTY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD 
3853-163249-0019 THEN YOU WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE 
3853-163249-0020 HE'S THE KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT THEE FAITHFULLY 
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW 
3853-163249-0022 IF YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTY SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM 
3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO 
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STARLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLDIERLY CHOKING VOICE 
3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY 
3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GUESTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS 
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LIFE HAS SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS 
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HIS SOUTH EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMACH AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK 
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE FIDDLES NOW WHEN I'M AN ASS OFTEN SO 
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO AUGHT THAN ADAM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF WALLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER 
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN 
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL EM POOR LONG SUFFERING CREATOR'S NAMES 
3853-163249-0033 WHILE HE ATE IT SAID CHANG ADDED ANN LIZY 
3853-163249-0034 NOW CYNTHY BEING SATISFIED 
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BOTANY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY 
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE AND HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRED EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY 
3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE 
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WHERE TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS 
3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD 
3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT 
3853-163249-0041 WE WELL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTY WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO 
3853-163249-0042 AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT ACT AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU 
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOREVER 
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE 
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HIDES TALK TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER 
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNEW THAT MY PRIDE HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT HAD NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BYE AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER 
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANYTHING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED 
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN 
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH THE BRAVE OR HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WETTING DOWN ANSWERED CHRISTY SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM THE HALF PACKED TRUNK OR NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GREY WOOLLEN STUFF 
3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWIS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY 
3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREAT HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU 
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHOWED ANY CURIOUS SAVE FOR THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS 
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOTH GOODWILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLANE TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND TO DAVID THIS EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESSING KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US 
3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND COUNSELS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW HIM BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET IN A WAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND END TO BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE 
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER 
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE 
422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BE LEAVING A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER 
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULE OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDANTS OF ALL SORTS 
422-122949-0002 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES 
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVE EARLY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED 
422-122949-0004 HE HONORS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS OF SELF GLORIFICATION 
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION 
422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS OR ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DID NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISE IT 
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING 
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORD GOOD AND STUPID 
422-122949-0009 FOR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION INDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DID NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY 
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINAL NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSE INTO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER 
422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPED TO MATURITY 
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOR THE INDIVIDUAL BEARS TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND ATTACH HIMSELF 
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THEIR MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD OF VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UPGROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPLE IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY 
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT NEW WHY'S NOTHING THAT YOU HOWLS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAYED DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVER FLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTIOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS OF MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL EXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION 
422-122949-0015 DANGERS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO THE NEIGHBOR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS 
422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH 
422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE 
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEA BE AN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEADING AS A MAN BODY AND SOUL 
422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS AND STRANGER ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF 
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT PATIENTS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE OR ORIGINATES THERE FROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION 
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE 
422-122949-0022 ALSO WHEN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER 
422-122949-0023 WHICH OF THE GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN THE SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGAN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS 
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS 
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE ITS SEPARATE ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE HIS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND 
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO WAS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION 
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HIS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS WERE NOT TOO HEAVY 
422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE 
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER THEE 
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HIM WILL YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT 
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN 
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IT IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU 
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE THROWN OVER MY TABLE 
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOLE AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOW A DAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO 
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS 
5338-24615-0000 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULI BARE LAWN CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR 
5338-24615-0001 THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES 
5338-24615-0002 OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSH LIKE A CIVIL AND FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TRAVEL TO THE GROWLINGLY MONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON 
5338-24615-0003 THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTOR'S UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOG BILL 
5338-24615-0004 YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL HIS FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA 
5338-24615-0005 THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NOURISH SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOWS COMPLETELY OVERARCHED THE BROAD ROAD PENNY 
5338-24615-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF A SHADY PARK THAT BOLTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY 
5338-24615-0007 THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE 
5338-24615-0008 IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE 
5338-24615-0009 NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER 
5338-24615-0010 STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE 
5338-24615-0011 TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE IN THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE ENCLOSURE 
5338-24615-0012 THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND 
5338-24615-0013 THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LETTER 
5338-24615-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP 
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT 
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MORTON REPLIED THE FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT 
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH ARE MORAL VIRTUE 
5338-24640-0003 MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN 
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HARE BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD A INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME 
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS 
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON AND MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED 
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE ROCKS OF THE INQUISITION 
5338-24640-0008 THEY HELD CONTENT AT BOWLS IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REINS 
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN ABOUT TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT 
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE 
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN 
5338-284437-0002 WHAT'S THAT LITTLE CABIN 
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE 
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED 
5338-284437-0005 THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN A CROWD 
5338-284437-0006 THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY 
5338-284437-0007 THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE 
5338-284437-0008 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND INNER ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS 
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKY'S BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY 
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TRAPS SKIN 
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN 
5338-284437-0012 THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST 
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEM TER PROVE A BUTTON BRIGHT OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE 
5338-284437-0014 ARE YOU A GIANT 
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU'RE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING A SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY 
5338-284437-0016 THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL 
5338-284437-0017 CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN 
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVER READY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AND A BLUE SKINS ARE SO FREIGHTED THEIR BOUDRU BUT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM 
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TORM LEANED GRAVELY 
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LOTS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND I'M ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS 
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE 
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY DOWNS THE GOOD PINKY'S WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE 
5338-284437-0023 NO OUR WAY IS BEST 
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN IS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER 
5338-284437-0025 I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE 
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINK TEAS IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD 
5338-284437-0027 AND THIS FORTUNATE BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE 
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE 
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS WET AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL ROT 
5338-284437-0030 YOU'RE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINK TEAS AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY 
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE AT FIRST AT THE FOOT IN OUR LAND 
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU 
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST 
5536-43358-0000 THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL MIND 
5536-43358-0001 THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS IT EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED 
5536-43358-0002 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCEND TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION 
5536-43358-0003 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER 
5536-43358-0004 AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY 
5536-43358-0005 THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED INWARD BAN THE DAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN THEIRS THE TRANSLATED FASTING IN DREAMING 
5536-43358-0006 THE FIRST BOMBAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE 
5536-43358-0007 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS ARE SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO 
5536-43358-0008 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THEIR HAIR REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMY FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER 
5536-43358-0009 WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS 
5536-43358-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IN PROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION 
5536-43358-0011 TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL 
5536-43358-0012 IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOUR OR HELP 
5536-43358-0013 FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE IN IMITATION AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH OR HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN 
5536-43358-0014 THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PURR 
5536-43358-0015 NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT OF BEES SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL 
5536-43358-0016 WHO MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION 
5536-43358-0017 HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE OF THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION 
5536-43358-0018 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBING A STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS AND LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPPING DALLIANCE OF THE RICH NEIGHBOUR 
5536-43358-0019 THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH 
5536-43359-0000 HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH 
5536-43359-0001 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION 
5536-43359-0002 THE ORDEAL IS BEST LET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASSED HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE 
5536-43359-0003 THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER IN THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE THAT YOU HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS 
5536-43359-0004 IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS 
5536-43359-0005 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK BOTH GRANDPARENTS AS THAT OF A QUAINT IN YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS 
5536-43359-0006 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNION BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT 
5536-43359-0007 THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED IN THE NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM IN A RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN 
5536-43359-0008 WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER 
5536-43359-0009 BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US SHE COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN 
5536-43359-0010 HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD 
5536-43359-0011 WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HAUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON THE SCENE AND A STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLOUD WITH RAINBOWS GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF THE GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGE WITH BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP 
5536-43359-0012 WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT PROVE HIS GRATITUDE 
5536-43359-0013 HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEETING CAST IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST AT THE REAL ELEMENT 
5536-43359-0014 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAMS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR 
5536-43359-0015 OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP 
5536-43359-0016 LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING 
5536-43359-0017 BUT YOU HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN 
5536-43359-0018 THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH 
5536-43363-0000 REINCARNATION IN THE CONVERSE OF SPIRITS 
5536-43363-0001 THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL 
5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS ARE BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES DASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD 
5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO MORE CONCERN ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS IN THEIR HOME 
5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING A RAWHIDE 
5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT DECIDED NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSE THE SPIRIT COULD YOU SEE IMPLEMENTS OR HEAP OF FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE 
5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE AND WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR A ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH 
5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGES TO ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD 
5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF THE YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH FORBID CEREMONIES 
5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED A COAL POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE IT HAD BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES ANOTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE 
5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAD BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS THEY PERSIAN CONJURORS HAD BECOME THE PAST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD 
5536-43363-0011 THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER 
5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES 
5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORNE ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD 
5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAN FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BUT SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY 
5536-43363-0015 FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER 
5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD 
5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLICE ON THE SAMOAN RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR IN A KING 
5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE NEEDS BELIEVE THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION 
5536-43363-0019 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MAN AND HIS BAND 
5694-64025-0000 SHILOH 
5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED 
5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA 
5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADNESS 
5694-64025-0004 AS GLEN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING 
5694-64025-0005 ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY 
5694-64025-0006 WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA REPEATED 
5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE HIM HAIL COLUMBIA 
5694-64025-0008 THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS 
5694-64025-0009 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY 
5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEING PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS 
5694-64025-0011 I BEEN FITTING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP ONLY ORDERED THE CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY 
5694-64025-0012 OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE 
5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED 
5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS OF EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW 
5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY 
5694-64025-0016 ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES 
5694-64025-0017 ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO HAVE CAPTURED ME MULE 
5694-64025-0018 IT WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT 
5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO 
5694-64025-0020 MULE DID NOT DESIRE CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR ANNO TWISTER ON HIS NOSE 
5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CASE ON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP 
5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULES NELL AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF A ROPE ACROSS THE CREEK 
5694-64025-0023 ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEM TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART 
5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN 
5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NATURAL THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY 
5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO 
5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY 
5694-64029-0004 THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF 
5694-64029-0005 I AM A V THAT YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME 
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY 
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF A RELIEF ON THE RODENT WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND 
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT 
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN 
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM 
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US 
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT 
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE 
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP BY THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS 
5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE GOOD BUT HE WAS NO GENTLE USAGE 
5694-64029-0016 I CALL THE DECK COLONEL FRIARS HIS ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE YANKEES ARE NOT LET IT FLY ARE THEY WILL CALL OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK 
5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT 
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK 
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE 
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING A HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASED FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MAN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MAN 
5694-64029-0021 OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW 
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED 
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN THE COME ON 
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AN HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE 
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER 
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONE 
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD 
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN 
5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES 
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED AT FOOT QUICK 
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US 
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK 
5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE 
5694-64038-0001 YANK SAYS WOODIE DILLON JOHN 
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND THE LAMP CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROAD ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON 
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DOZEN ELATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY 
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND BOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE ARE MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP 
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS 
5694-64038-0006 A YANKEE AULUS'S NAGGER 
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY 
5694-64038-0008 A MAN IN THE WELL 
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD 
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT 
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM 
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT 
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL ROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR 
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T LIKE HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE 
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER 
5694-64038-0016 WHITBY FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT 
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES 
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE IN THE HERD TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH AND EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT AND EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEAT 
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME UNTIL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND AGAIN HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO 
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER WILD JIM SAYS GENTLEMAN AY DANNY THE LAW 
5694-64038-0021 YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW 
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT GEMMA TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST 
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PLIGHT 
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT 
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT 
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET 
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR 
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY 
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU ARE ONLY THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY 
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW 
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THERE OOZING WATER 
1462-170145-0006 IF HE'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONE TO ME OR ANYTHING 
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING 
1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME 
1462-170145-0009 O BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME 
1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER 
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING 
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR 
1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT 
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN 
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE 
1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED 
1462-170145-0017 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASK ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON 
1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY 
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
1462-170145-0020 YES I KNOW VERY WELL 
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY 
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME 
5895-34615-0000 BUT HIS LAUGHTER AS SYNONYM OF JOY 
5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE 
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT 
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE 
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION 
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS AMOUNT TO BANK 
5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM 
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWEN PLAINS LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF 
5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR 
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RECTUS 
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT 
5895-34615-0011 AN EVERLASTING LAUGH 
5895-34615-0012 THE MANY PEONS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OAK ASIAN ALETE GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL 
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT 
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION WHEN PLANES LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING 
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER IT WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY 
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENCE ASLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA 
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE 
5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR 
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLEY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH 
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MAIN BEEN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT 
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHAT EVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD 
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES 
5895-34622-0001 IN GLEN PLAINS EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE 
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING 
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE 
5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS 
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AT THE GREEN BOX 
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TOO PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE 
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING 
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE 
5895-34622-0009 I KNOW PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT 
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING 
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FARIS AND FACE THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE 
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER 
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYMPLANE SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SO SCIENCE IN ART IN THE HIGHWAYS 
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE RED PHOEBE IN VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION 
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED BEING ASCRIBED THE TEMPLE 
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER 
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BED CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE 
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER 
5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT 
5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES 
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM 
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR 
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THAT PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA 
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF WORK 
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS 
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES 
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTIST'S DOOR 
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX 
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE IT READY MADE 
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE 
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN 
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHOEBE AND SOMETIMES THE NUSS 
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY 
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES 
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THERE IS SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MAN TO BANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL 
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTH WORK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRED THE LAUGHING MAN 
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNT TO BANKS OF TIDINGS O FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE 
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC 
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRIGHT THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND A GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN 
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS 
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL 
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE 
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE 
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS 
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE'VE JUST SEEN SOLD AS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK 
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED 
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE 
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS 
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN 
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM 
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS 
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM 
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR 
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SAYING MASTER NICHOLAS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM 
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED 
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL 
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS 
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP FALL CURRY 
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER 
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND 
6241-61943-0003 MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET 
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS 
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE WAS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HERO PRINCE OF DENMARK 
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARDWICK SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT 
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY 
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND ORE WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MITCHELL'S YOKE WILL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY 
6241-61943-0009 THE VULGAR HE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD 
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS 
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND 
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL 
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US 
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BEARING TRAMP 
6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH 
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGE IS SAVED ICELANDIC IN LATIN 
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER 
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS ON GOES WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER 
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE 
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SOCK NEWSOME 
6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM 
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY 
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES 
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION 
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS IN THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY 
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH TRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION 
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LATTER OF HUMANITY AND THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE 
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION IN LIBERTY 
6241-61946-0001 HANS ARE EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP 
6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR 
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUED VEST CURED ANGER 
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN 
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW 
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG AND HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR 
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM 
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE 
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE 
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STOVE 
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BIRD OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE 
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY 
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNUFFLES WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS 
6241-61946-0014 THEY CONSIST SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET 
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WERE GARTER WAS TO BE FOUND 
6241-61946-0016 THE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM 
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD 
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS 
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO WAIT 
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES 
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION 
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER 
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMAN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION 
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED 
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WILL BIGGER ONES CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS 
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED 
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS 
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST 
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNDER THE SECOND GENERATION 
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE 
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSON INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI 
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD 
6241-66616-0009 WANT ME ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD 
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEWSON'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE SHOULDER 
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN HER EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED AND POOR ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS 
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THE INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS 
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOUNDS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS 
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS 
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI IN HIS FORESTS 
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK 
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WITH A SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLANNED WITH THEM 
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCE'S MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS 
6241-66616-0019 THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE 
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND IN SUMMER 
6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY APPEARED THIS WINTER THAN YOU CAN EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS 
6241-66616-0022 WE'LL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKING 
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME A BIGGER ONES REPLY 
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD OF SPRUCE WOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER 
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND RAWDON HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE 
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOME COMING 
6295-244435-0001 COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY 
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE MOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY 
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE 
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBOUR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY 
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG IN THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THE SUMTER IS OURS 
6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED 
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS 
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST IN NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE 
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE 
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SETS IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY 
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM 
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH 
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT 
6295-244435-0014 POOR GERDA ONCE WROTE AN ORDER 
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY 
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO IS WELL UP THERE 
6295-244435-0017 HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DU LINNAEUS WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE 
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOODBYE 
6295-244435-0019 HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET 
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVER FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN 
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL 
6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED IN GRAVE 
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM 
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS 
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VAULT ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION 
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE 
6295-244435-0027 HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY 
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLESTON OUT OF SIGHT 
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE 
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION 
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT 
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESS 
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY 
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY 
6295-244435-0035 BILL STILL IN HIS GANG THEN NOW NEARS HER UP 
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERY MEN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT 
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS 
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SADDLEBAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERY MAN RODE AWAY 
6295-244435-0039 THIS IS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE 
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED 
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TEST BRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA 
6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY 
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH 
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT 
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL 
6295-64301-0005 BLESS EM I HEAR NOW MY GOD AND BLESS SHALL I BE THERE THEN 
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS 
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS 
6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE ON THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH 
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT 
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE 
6295-64301-0011 LEDDY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR 
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS 
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VILE AND WERE SURE TO MARRY A MUSIC 
6295-64301-0014 THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE 
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING 
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY 
6295-64301-0017 LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC 
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOLE CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD 
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM 
6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN 
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS IN TREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF 
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD 
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARE RIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE 
6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL I LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN 
6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM 
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM ASSERTING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER 
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONCHES CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID 
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THAT BEEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL 
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH THE TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD 
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE 
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HISSELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD 
6295-64301-0032 IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED

6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCK TO STEADY HIMSELF HAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY DUTY TOO CURIOUS 
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAYED OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYON

6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL IN SIDEY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS 
6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMY WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE 
6313-66129-0018 AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE AND SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORE NOON 
6313-66129-0019 A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED 
6313-66129-0020 THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE 
6313-66129-0021 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONY SIMMY TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LINKS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN 
6313-66129-0022 ALL AGREED THAT TED SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM 
6313-66129-0023 GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOYS FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY 
6313-66129-0024 THEN IT BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RED 
6313-66129-0025 GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND 
6313-66129-0026 THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSHED THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND OUT AND WHAT'S MORE TED BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED HIS SOMBRERO ON HIGH 
6313-66129-0027 THAT BOY'S HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DEAD SAVE STACY BROWN 
6313-66129-0028 TEN IS AN EXPERIENCED WRITER 
6313-66129-0029 THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND 
6313-66129-0030 WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY 
6313-66129-0031 PAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED

6313-66129-0033 WHAT'S MORE STACY APPROACH THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN THE SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE 
6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT TO MUSTER UP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE PALL 
6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING 
6313-76958-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP 
6313-76958-0001 EVEN IF I CAN'T SAY AND I CAN BEAT THAT 
6313-76958-0002 NOW WHILE THE RANGE WHAT DEMANDED THE BLIGHT 
6313-76958-0003 A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE 
6313-76958-0004 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AN THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT 
6313-76958-0005 WALTER HAD GOT OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMPFIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING 
6313-76958-0006 NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW 
6313-76958-0007 WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY BAND AS BE FIT AS A FIDDLE 
6313-76958-0008 HUMPH GRUNTED CURLY ADAMS 
6313-76958-0009 BUT WHAT DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE 
6313-76958-0010 BUT LETS THEM THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN 
6313-76958-0011 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS 
6313-76958-0012 STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT 
6313-76958-0013 THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAILER SELDOM SIT DOWN 
6313-76958-0014 IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDER SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH 
6313-76958-0015 STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN 
6313-76958-0016 YOU WON'T BE SO FAT AS TO WAKE UP HARDWORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON 
6313-76958-0017 WANTEE BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP 
6313-76958-0018 HEY THERE ARE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH PAGAN NATIONS THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE 
6313-76958-0019 STACY BROWN'S AT LEFT LEG SLUNG OVER THE SADDLE 
6313-76958-0020 WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY 
6313-76958-0021 KEEP A DELIGHT AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWERS THE SLEEPY KALMAN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON THE CATTLE DRIVE 
6313-76958-0022 ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON 
6313-76958-0023 GRAT PILE GRABBED PILE 
6313-76958-0024 WHO IS THE WRITER OF THIS MORNING AS THE FORUM AND GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MAN 
6313-76958-0025 A WRANGLERS ARE LANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT'S DOUGHTILY 
6313-76958-0026 HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL TIME MAKING TROUBLE IS A V S STACY INNOCENTLY 
6313-76958-0027 ALTHOUGH THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN 
6313-76958-0028 HE'S A TROUBLED CURED NOT A TROUBLE MAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF 
6313-76958-0029 PALMA TELL YOU GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE THAT MALES TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS 
6313-76958-0030 HAL ASKED TAD 
6313-76958-0031 WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING 
6319-275224-0000 WHAT TALK FOSSES MARRIED ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS 
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT AN UNNATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS OURS TO YOU UPON NOT ALL 
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THOUGH WHY OLD CAN VOL VIEWLESS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU 
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY ALL ROOTS 
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATED IN A NATURAL MANNER 
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREES STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN THE GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SAID PERRY ALREADY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS 
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY IN WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK 
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT 
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE 
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS 
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH 
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE COME BOLDLY WAS POLLED TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND 
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS 
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE 
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT 
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES 
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL 
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN 
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVORITE GARDEN 
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HIS SHOULDER 
6319-275224-0020 I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH 
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST CROSS LIGHTS HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EDDY A NIGHTS OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF MOSAIC RITES 
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST 
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE IN WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS 
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY 
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM 
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEMS STRANGER INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LIL BOSS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY 
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRAVITY OF MATTER IN FACT OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST 
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRITS AND UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ASSES HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH THE MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST 
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF THEM THAT THENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ALLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES 
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED ARM BILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DECEIT WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST IS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH IMPASSABLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY 
1673-143396-0011 A FOETUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINTS TO ITS FULL MATURITY AND STYLES THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING IT DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF ASTRAL MATTER 
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY THAT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY 
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST ANY MORTAL AND IMPASSABLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEROMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE 
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FEET OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROPHANE 
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CORINTHUS 
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF AFTEN ASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOUR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEAL THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES 
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION 
1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE ALLOWED US FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE 
1673-143396-0019 BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH THE REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH 
1673-143396-0020 UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABBOT'S SERAPION HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATIGABLE ARDOR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PERUSED THE FOUR GOSPELS THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES AND THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS 
1673-143397-0000 ARDENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HERESY CAROL AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OPPRESSING RENOVATIONS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTARIES 
1673-143397-0001 WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENSE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARCH AT THE DAWN OF THE DAY LET A SEDITIOUS MULTITUDES TO THE ATTACK OF THE SYNAGOGUES 
1673-143397-0002 SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMISCUOUS OUTRAGED THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLONY 
1673-143397-0003 THE ZEAL OF CAROL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW THUS IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE 
1673-143397-0004 ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MENACES OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PREFECT OF EGYPT 
1673-143397-0005 A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER IS BEYOND WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PREFECT OF THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED 
1673-143397-0006 WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITANS OF EUROPE AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCE IS IN ANTIOCH AND ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DIOCESE BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE 
1673-143397-0007 EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERETICKS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS 
1673-143397-0008 AT THESE BLASPHEMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN 
1673-143397-0009 BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSENGERS OF EGYPT 
1673-143397-0010 THE VANITY OF KEHL ASSIGNED WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MONTH DECIDED THE FATE OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLERGY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS 
1673-143397-0011 NESTORIUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR CHRISTOPHE TO DISCLAIM THE JURISDICTION AND TO DISOBEY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT 
1673-143397-0012 SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METROPOLITAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHREN 
1673-143397-0013 BY THE VIGILANCE OF MEMNON THE CHURCHES WERE SHUT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS TURNED TO THE CATHEDRAL 
1673-143397-0014 DURING A BUSY PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPEROR TRIED EVERY METHOD ACCEPTS THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONCILE THIS THEOLOGICAL QUARREL 
1673-143397-0015 RETURNED YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING 
1673-143397-0016 THE FEEBLE SUN OF ARCADIUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAYED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE EUNUCHS AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPERSTITION AND AVARICE WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHODOX SHEETS WERE ITS INJURIOUS IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER 
1673-143397-0017 BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY 
1673-143397-0018 AT THE SAME TIME THAT EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONE WAS ASSAULTED WITH GOLD 
1673-143397-0019 THE PASS HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UNPOPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF THE SCHISMATIC SUE REVERED HISTORIANS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FAITH 
1673-143397-0020 A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLAM EYES OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED THE CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD MISTER IS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE AND HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AN ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF SAVAGES 
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS 
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARRIES INTO THE WORLD THEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED 
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE 
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND 
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM 
6319-57405-0005 THE DAIRY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH 
6319-57405-0006 BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND 
6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED 
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED 
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPT INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE 
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PARA 
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION 
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF THE NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM 
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN 
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD IN UNTO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK 
6319-64726-0002 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND 
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE 
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT 
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THEN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY 
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS 
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WHICH IS IN DESPAIR BUT MUST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THE AFFAIR ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD 
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE 
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER IN THE PATH 
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FORE COURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE 
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT 
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP 
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP MAKE CHAIRS ARE STANDING 
6319-64726-0014 I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU 
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT BEEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY 
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY 
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER 
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT 
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HO BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE 
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD 
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEANY AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WITH A LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB 
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE IN THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS THEY FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE 
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEANY UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THEIR STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL 
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY NUDE LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWAMPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE 
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY 
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE FOR SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND 
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS 
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WAS SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND 
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS 
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS THE SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER 
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS 
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL 
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET 
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST IN YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM 
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING 
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING 
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY 
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST 
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A NEST OF FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN 
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR ON WILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS 
6345-64257-0020 WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN 
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS 
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE AND MAIDENLY DIFFIDENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS 
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS 
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING IN HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE 
6345-93302-0004 AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY 
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER 
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT 
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE 
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION 
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT 
6345-93302-0010 THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET 
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD 
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WHITE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR 
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD IT IS 
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING 
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SILK HAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS 
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAIL TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY 
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PENSIONED JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER 
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME AS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID IT 
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST 
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT BUT HOW CAN I EVER TRUSTY OAK 
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW 
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US 
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HUM AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL 
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT 
6345-93302-0025 THEY REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS 
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT 
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT AIR 
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE 
6345-93302-0029 SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST 
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR 
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING IN THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAYS APPOINTED TORTURE 
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THAN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL 
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE 
6345-93306-0004 NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE 
6345-93306-0005 THERE'S A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED 
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES 
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT 
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU 
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE IMPRESSED IT UPON HER 
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM 
6345-93306-0011 IT'S ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED 
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY 
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAIDEN A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT 
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND 
6345-93306-0015 WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE 
6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID AH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPEN TO COME THIS WAY 
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE 
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER OF TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE 
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE'T UPON SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET QUAINTED WID DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED 
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED 
6345-93306-0021 ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE A LATCH KEY 
6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY 
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASS THE NIGHT AT HILLVIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN 
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRLS TAKEN IMPERATOR SISTER SILK STOCKINGS AND HIS NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT IN PEACE 
6345-93306-0025 IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CAST A NET CALLED HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRACTION ON PLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS

777-126732-0030 STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE TEARING OFF HIS TRUNK TO BED WITH THEM 
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TOURIST AS OF RIGID SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN

777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO RIDE AT THIS TIME 
777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GREAT SETTLE DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND THE CALLOUS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF THE PENITENTIARY CUT UP IMPETUOUSLY 
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMET GOSSIPINGS THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE 
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED AND ADDED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS 
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL A CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NURSING AGREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESH IN THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE 
777-126732-0041 STEVIE SWALLOW THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR 
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT 
777-126732-0043 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS 
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT 
777-126732-0045 THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP CONSCIOUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE OR EATING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE OTHER FANATICS 
777-126732-0046 IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME 
777-126732-0047 THE THING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS HE KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHERE AS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR 
777-126732-0048 THESE ARE BUT A FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED THE SHOP E TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE 
777-126732-0049 THE SURVEY WAS UNFAVORABLE 
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DOOR AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS 
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION 
777-126732-0052 MISTER ROEBUCK PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE 
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE 
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED AND GESTICULATING A MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN 
777-126732-0055 STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE 
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLATES FOR THE NIGHT 
777-126732-0057 HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD AND HER HUSBAND'S FACE 
777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FILLS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE 
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE ONLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN 
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER LOCKE BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL 
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDA PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD 
777-126732-0062 YES BUT ALL WELL 
777-126732-0063 DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY AND CAST THEM TO CAST THEM IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM 
777-126732-0064 THAT POOR BOY'S NEVER EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LAST FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK 
777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE A REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED 
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD 
777-126732-0067 MISTER VER LOCKS ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING 
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE 
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID 
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WAS THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT 
777-126732-0071 MISTER PHILIP WAS FULLER RESPONSIVENESS 
777-126732-0072 A SCRAWL YAWNED HE GROWLED SAVAGELY

777-126732-0077 HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM 
777-126732-0078 I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT 
777-126732-0079 THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN OX SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE 
777-126732-0080 HE CAN'T STAND EMOTION OF ANY CRUELTY 
777-126732-0081 COMFORTABLE DEAR 
7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HONORABLE THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE 
7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROMPTLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS 
7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER AND TELL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD 
7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID 
7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS 
7850-111771-0005 HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES 
7850-111771-0006 THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING 
7850-111771-0007 TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURE THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR 
7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS 
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE 
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BERTA CANS 
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE 
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU 
7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME 
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY 
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD 
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO OUR NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES 
7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY 
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET'S ASK HER TO TEA CHESTS 
7850-281318-0009 SO THE GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE 
7850-281318-0010 OH WISE MOTHER MAKE PIE DEAR MOTHER MAKE PIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY 
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS 
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST 
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE 
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES 
7850-281318-0015 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN 
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW 
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER BAKED PIE YOU MUST PLACE ON STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISSCROSSED CRISS CROSSED SO

7850-281318-0020 MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE 
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COZY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER 
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL 
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER 
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO 
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DIS GRACEFUL 
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL 
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER EAT BETWEEN MEALS 
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID 
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS WERE THROUGH GILLS BUT TO ENTER SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES 
7850-286674-0006 POOR PHIPPS ASKED THE LARVAE 
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LORD LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH 
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER 
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR FLORID LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD 
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARE LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD 
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS A SLIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY 
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DA WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE 
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES A SNIFF OF THE TURTLE 
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME TO THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT 
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER 
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW ON HIS LEGS VAIREE VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HEART LOWER SHALL TOUCH THE MUD THE LAST LARKWELL CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL 
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY 
174-168635-0000 HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND 
174-168635-0001 THE HEART OF FAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY 
174-168635-0002 HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VACANT FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM 
174-168635-0003 HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF THE HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING 
174-168635-0004 ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND WHO IS AT EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT 
174-168635-0005 COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING 
174-168635-0006 SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION 
174-168635-0007 THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLDER POORER SHE THOUGHT JOHN FELT ON HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY 
174-168635-0008 NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JOHN FELL JOHN ANDREWS THAT DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF 
174-168635-0009 TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER 
174-168635-0010 WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY 
174-168635-0011 MOREOVER JOHN TELL JOHN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL 
174-168635-0012 HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN 
174-168635-0013 WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL 
174-168635-0014 COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING 
174-168635-0015 AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PREY 
174-168635-0016 HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING DEAD ON DRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE 
174-168635-0017 THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS 
174-168635-0018 HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISCUSSED AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN TO THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SHORTER REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT'S SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM 
174-168635-0019 WHO KNOWS WHETHER JOHN FELL JOHN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE 
174-168635-0020 ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THEN POSSESSED 
174-168635-0021 HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM 
174-168635-0022 HE WAS THE CHILD STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PAW 
7850-73752-0000 FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE 
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE 
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE 
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY HER FRIEND FERDINAND ARE MINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABELLE WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES 
7850-73752-0004 FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS 
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING 
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANED OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS AND CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY 
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOMINY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD 
7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORT WARREN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEM SHOWERED AT HIS FEET 
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION 
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA 
7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED 
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM 
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO 
7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY 
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER 
7850-73752-0016 HE MAY BE ENCHANTED BUT DOUBTLESS THE TALISMAN 
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME 
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA 
7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE INQUIRED MISS TEMPLE 
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER 
7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE 
7976-105575-0002 OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED 
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREAST WORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BURGRAVE IN HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT 
7976-105575-0004 NOT BALACLAVA NOR THE ALMO SOL SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS THE DUEL TO THE DEATH 
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR WHILE SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME 
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING RABBLE WERE SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT 
7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD 
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS ARE MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING 
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT 
7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED 
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JEANIE KING 
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI 
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LAUGHED WEAKLY IN THE WORST OF IT TOO 
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT 
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY 
7976-105575-0016 ONCE A NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TITIAN MANGO HOTEL TO SEE LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST 
7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND 
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED 
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE 
7976-105575-0020 I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES 
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS 
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TO MOW THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS 
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS 
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNVARIED DEAD 
7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS 
7976-105575-0026 ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN 
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTHS A GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE RENT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME 
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED 
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT WHILES WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR 
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS 
7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON ACCOUNT 
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED HER FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU

7976-110124-0009 BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO HER FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER 
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BAKER 
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL MIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING 
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BAKER HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM 
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY 
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK 
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE 
7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN 
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER 
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED 
7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM 
7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE 
7976-110124-0021 PAST THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER 
7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR 
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR 
7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS 
7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH 
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US 
7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES 
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US 
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN 
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBIND THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT 
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE 
7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH 
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CROSSED WITH THE CHILDREN 
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PEACE 
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN 
7976-110523-0010 HUSTLE THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE THE WHOLE BROKE A LARGE ROUND PAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY 
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE 
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVIOUR A KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAY CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BRIGHT HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THE MEN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY 
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK A PENCIL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE 
7976-110523-0014 GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WHICH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED 
7976-110523-0015 WELL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM 
7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED 
7976-110523-0017 CREAKE IS SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT OUT THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL 
7976-110523-0018 C I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF 
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN 
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES 
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK 
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNY DICK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RENDEL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB 
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER 
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE AND THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED OR HANDLE 
8297-275154-0003 RENDEL WAITED AWHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENEDICT MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT 
8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SIDON THEM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM 
8297-275154-0005 HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM 
8297-275154-0006 RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION KATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW 
8297-275154-0007 AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT 
8297-275154-0008 HE DISTRESSED ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY 
8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY 
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER 
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION 
8297-275154-0012 RANDALL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNEY IS 
8297-275154-0013 I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER 
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF THE AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK 
8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE 
8297-275154-0016 I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF 
8297-275154-0017 OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS 
8297-275154-0018 I'M AFRAID HE SAID 
8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW 
8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD 
8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT 
8297-275154-0022 YOU CAN'T DO IT 
8297-275154-0023 LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST 
8297-275154-0024 I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY 
8297-275154-0025 SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE 
8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY 
8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANT SAID MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RAMBLE AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY 
8297-275155-0000 ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDALL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SIDON THEM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER 
8297-275155-0001 THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDALL BOUGHT IT 
8297-275155-0002 AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE 
8297-275155-0003 RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH 
8297-275155-0004 WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER 
8297-275155-0005 MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER OR OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER 
8297-275155-0006 MISSUS PREST EET WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL 
8297-275155-0007 HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN 
8297-275155-0008 SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY 
8297-275155-0009 BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SIDON HIM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS 
8297-275155-0010 THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND 
8297-275155-0011 BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A PORT AS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WITH SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVOUR NEWSPAPERS 
8297-275155-0012 YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW 
8297-275155-0013 SIT DOWN SAID MISS PRISSY 
8297-275155-0014 YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDY SEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US 
8297-275155-0015 HE WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER 
8297-275155-0016 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM 
8297-275155-0017 WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE 
8297-275155-0018 AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW 
8297-275155-0019 OR STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU FOR STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED 
8297-275155-0020 BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER 
8297-275155-0021 HONESTLY 
8297-275155-0022 AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN 
8297-275155-0023 SHE ASKED DIRECTLY OF HER FATHER WAS DEAD 
8297-275155-0024 THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESLEY YOU DEFENSES THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS 
8297-275155-0025 RANDALL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE 
8297-275155-0026 A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED 
8297-275155-0027 HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN PETTY DECK 
8297-275155-0028 NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW 
8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RAMBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF KATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENEDICT TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND 
8297-275155-0030 GOOD BYE DEAR RANDAL 
8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION RENDEL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN 
8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN 
8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED 
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU'VE SEEN CATHERINE 
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT 
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE THE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY 
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE 
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PREST THE HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POUR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES BRAVES THAN IN SUPPER BULL OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD 
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING KATHERINE TO GRANT'S SIDNEY AN INTERVIEW 
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNY DECKS PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDALL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM 
8297-275156-0008 B THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDALL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW 
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND 
8297-275156-0010 WHAT A HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDALL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER AND TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE 
8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW 
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DESPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING 
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR KATHERINE'S REPLY 
84-121123-0000 GO DO YOU HEAR 
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT 
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY 
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE 
84-121123-0004 DEVIN HE RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE 
84-121123-0005 DAVENEY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND BELOW FORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN 
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER PUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS 
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR 
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED PHIL FORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE 
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED NOW 
84-121123-0010 NO JAY LOOKED UPON MORALE WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION 
84-121123-0011 SAID MARA SADLY YES REPLIED MATTIE 
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR 
84-121123-0013 ASKED WELL YES 
84-121123-0014 MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO 
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES 
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOR EVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK 
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO IT EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THE SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER 
84-121123-0018 MOREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM 
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE 
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF ITA WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS 
84-121123-0021 BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER 
84-121123-0022 THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE 
84-121123-0023 WHAT A WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE 
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACH WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JEST AND CLOSE TO THE LIPS 
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS 
84-121123-0026 DAVENEY SETTLE FORT BE SO KIND OF AS HE CHOOSES TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU'LL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM 
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT 
84-121123-0028 I'M GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE 
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES 
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID HONOR WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL 
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING 
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LEADS A VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM 
84-121550-0004 HE I NEWCOMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHEA PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE A LATCH TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST 
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELING BUT THE PSALM DELICATE ASSAY GIVE ITS LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT 
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOLON ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE 
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS D FALL TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY 
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVORED DOES TRANSCEND AND NOT WITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE 
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED 
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS AWAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY HOLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN 
84-121550-0011 NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FROM ME AND WITH HER CHOIR YOUR RONNIE AND MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK 
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES 
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINS DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLORS WHENCE THE SOUNDS BELOW IS MADE AND TO DELIA'S GIRDLE 
84-121550-0014 THE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WHERE THEN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART 
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRYPHON'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG 
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR ERE GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE 
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED 
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN 
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD ALIKE INHABIT BUT LIGHT IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE 
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLD AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTO DIETED 
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VEINY SPONSA DE BANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER 
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH AIR FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH 
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED 
84-121550-0024 TOUSSAINT TO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRAW HOME OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME 
84-121550-0025 DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEEDS MUST WEEP 
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER 
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I AM BEATRICE 
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH 
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHOSE WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THIS THIN AND DOLBY OF ONE MEASURE 
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGE ASS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH A LOFTY VAPORS FOR THEIR RAIN IT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT 
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS 
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION 
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT 
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO 
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT ADVANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM 
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF PALMS BY THE ITALIAN'S CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE BE TO NUOVA PROSE AND VERSE 
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POET TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT 
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD PALM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE 
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY 
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW 
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AN EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONG TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF A STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF WAS SCANTILY SUPPLIED 
8842-302196-0006 HE AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSES OF THE PALM WHICH ARE EMITTED 
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED 
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE POULTRY IN USELESS 
8842-302196-0009 IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THEN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF 
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE BEATEN WALL THAT THERE'S A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA 
8842-302196-0011 A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTE A SUBTLE BIOGRAPHY 
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE BEAT THEM LAVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE 
8842-302201-0000 THERE AFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST 
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERSE TIMES MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY 
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE 
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MAYBE ATTITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME 
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS 
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHED SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGNED 
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE TO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THREW THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE 
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WENT ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG 
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE 
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE YOUR SONG I KNOW 
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR 
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD AND SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINT HEARTEDNESS 
8842-302201-0012 IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM 
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED 
8842-302201-0014 THE SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL AND THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER 
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE 
174-50561-0000 FORGOTTEN TOO THE NAME OF GILLIAN THE LOVELY CAPTIVE 
174-50561-0001 WORSE AND WORSE HE IS STIFF AND PRESUMED TO BE THE CAPTIVE SWEETHEART WHO WHEEDLES THE FLOWER OF THE RING AND THE PRISON KEY OUT OF THE STRICT VIRGINS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND FLIES WITH HER AT LAST IN A SHALLOP ACROSS THE SEA TO LIVE WITH HER HAPPILY EVER AFTER 
174-50561-0002 BUT THIS IS A FALLACY 
174-50561-0003 THE WANDERING SINGER APPROACHES THEM WITH HIS LUTE 
174-50561-0004 THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER 
174-50561-0005 LADY LADY MY ROSE WHITE LADY BUT WILL YOU NOT HEAR A ROUND O LADY 
174-50561-0006 OH IF YOU PLAY A SIR ROUNDELL SINGER HOW CAN THAT HARMS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER 
174-50561-0007 SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK THAT WE DANCED A WEEK WITH HER THOUGHTS A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER OH MY HONEY SWEET SINGER 
174-50561-0008 BUT IF I PLAY YOU AROUND A LADY GET ME A GIFT FROM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER HER FINGER RING FOR MY FINGER RING THOUGH SHE SPLASHED A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY OH MY ROSE WHITE LADY 
174-50561-0009 THE WANDERING SINGER 
174-50561-0010 BUT I DID ONCE HAVE THE LUCK TO HEAR AND SEE THE LADY PLAYED IN ENTIRETY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN GRANTED LEAVE TO PLAY JUST ONE MORE GAME BEFORE BEDTIME AND OF COURSE THEY CHOSE THE LONGEST AND PLAYED IT WITHOUT MISSING A SYLLABLE 
174-50561-0011 THE LADIES IN YELLOW DRESSES STAND AGAIN IN A RING ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER AND ARE FOR THE LAST TIME ACCOSTED BY THE SINGER WITH HIS LUTE 
174-50561-0012 THE WANDERING SINGER 
174-50561-0013 I'LL PLAY FOR YOU NOW NEATH THE APPLE BOUGH AND YOU SHALL DREAM OF LAWNS AND SHADY LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY OH MY APPLE OLD LADY 
174-50561-0014 THE LADIES 
174-50561-0015 NOW YOU MAY PLAY AS SERENE A SINGER A DREAM OF NIGHT FOR AN AMPLE OLD LADY FOR THE FRUIT IS NOT ONE THE APPLE BOUGH AND THE MOON IS UP AND THE LONG AND SHADY SINNER SINNER WANDERING SINGER OH MY HONEY SWEET SINGER 
174-50561-0016 ONCE MORE THE SINGER PLAYS AND THE LADIES DANCE BUT ONE BY ONE THEY FALL ASLEEP TO THE DROWSY MUSIC AND THEN THE SINGERS STEPS INTO THE RING AND UNLOCKS THE TOWER AND KISSES THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER 
174-50561-0017 I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF THE LADIES 
174-50561-0018 BEDTIME CHILDREN 
174-50561-0019 YOU SEE THE TREATMENT IS A TRIFLE FANCIFUL 
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE ONE UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD 
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY FANTASY BUT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE OH EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE 
8842-302203-0002 WHEREBY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SANG SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED 
8842-302203-0003 WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION 
8842-302203-0004 IN MY HUGH WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY OH LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT HAVE SHAKEN ME SO MUCH 
8842-302203-0005 AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESSED ME BUT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HELPFUL THING 
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAUL I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS AND THE UNCERTAIN STATE THAT STEPPED INTO 
8842-302203-0007 THESE WILL BRING PHANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD 
8842-302203-0008 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WASN'T THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO 
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY A TEAM OF IT' SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM 
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN AND CHANCE TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JONAH BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARBLE INSTANTLY 
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE 
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY MAN MANGLED BY THE LIGHTNINGS OF GODHEAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE 
8842-304647-0001 QUEEN SHE IMPASTO BEAUTEE 
8842-304647-0002 AND FLESH WAS RAYMOND SAID HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE ROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOFTNESS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOUR'S ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEAD SAINTS CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE HOW ALL HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR MEN HOW HE AT LAST THE JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN 
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPORS WHELMED YOUR EYES ON WORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND HIS SPLENDOR BENT UPON HIS SHAME 
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES IMPLIED IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE IN IGNORANT PRETENCE OR FOUL TO SEE 
8842-304647-0005 A PALPABLE IN ABASED HIM 
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE AS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS THE LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPIFIED BY BUGBEARS VEIN 
8842-304647-0007 MOST WONDERFUL 
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MAGDALEN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALMA NOW 
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF ROCKS NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DREAM LOST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US NINA'S CRICKETS ON DRY SUARD 
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKED LOVE WOULD FILCH OUR HOARD WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES SLUICING ARE VAIN AND VIGOR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF LIFE BY SPILTH OF LIFE WITHIN US STORED 
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THE BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HELSTON AHEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE IN EYES AND SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CAN TYRANNIZE 
8842-304647-0012 DUE TO BE THEIR PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD 
8842-304647-0013 VALLETTA ARCTURUS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDEST MY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY 
174-84280-0000 HOW WE MUST SIMPLIFY 
174-84280-0001 IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATION CE OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY 
174-84280-0002 IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND NOT YOUNGER THAN WE DO 
174-84280-0003 WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPED MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING 
174-84280-0004 AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING TABLEAU BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND STAFF THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD 
174-84280-0005 FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSCURED FOR LYING FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN 
174-84280-0006 IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN THIS STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTIN 
174-84280-0007 I BECAME GROTESQUELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER 
174-84280-0008 YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU 
174-84280-0009 WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET 
174-84280-0010 IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING 
174-84280-0011 BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH 
174-84280-0012 AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF EDIBLE JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THE EYE WOULD END THIS WRITING 
174-84280-0013 IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE TRUMPED UP LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION 
174-84280-0014 WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER 
174-84280-0015 SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX
